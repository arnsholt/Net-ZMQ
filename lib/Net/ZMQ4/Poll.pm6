# This is a temporary function. Ideally, we'd like to allow the user to poll
# several sockets at the same time (obviously). But the zmq_poll function
# takes an array of pollitems as zmq_pollitem_t*, but in NativeCall we can
# only express an array as zmq_pollitem_t**. So we currently only expose
# polling of a single socket.
#
# We could expose polling of several sockets by creating a multi-pollitem with
# several pollitems repeated in a single CStruct, but that's a hack. to get it
# working properly, we need NativeCall to support arrays of value structs
# rather than reference structs.
